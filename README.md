## Application Architecture

Shop-App follows a clean architecture pattern with separation of concerns:


1. **UI Layer**: Screen and widget components that users interact with
   - Screens (HomePage, ProductDetailsPage, CartPage)
   - Widgets (ProductCard, ProductList)

2. **State Management Layer**: Provider implementation for app state
   - CartProvider for shopping cart operations
   - ChangeNotifier pattern for UI updates

3. **Data Layer**: Product data and models
   - Static product data in global_variables.dart
   - Product and cart item data structures

The application architecture ensures:
- Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data
- Predictable state management
- Easily maintainable and testable code
- Efficient rebuilds with the Provider pattern

## UI Components

The app utilizes a custom theme with consistent styling throughout:

```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  fontFamily: 'Lato',
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: const Color.fromRGBO(254, 206, 1, 1),
    primary: const Color.fromRGBO(254, 206, 1, 1),
  ),
  // Other theme configurations...
),
```

Key UI components include:

1. **ProductCard**: Displays product information in a visually appealing card format
2. **Product Filtering Chips**: Interactive filter options for browsing by category
3. **Size Selection**: Interactive size picker in the product details page
4. **Cart Item**: Individual cart item with image, title, and removal option
5. **Bottom Navigation**: Persistent navigation between home and cart screens

## State Management

Shop-App implements the Provider pattern for state management, offering a lightweight and efficient solution for sharing and updating state across the widget tree.

```dart
// CartProvider implementation
class CartProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  final List<Map<String, dynamic>> cart = [];

  void addProduct(Map<String, dynamic> product) {
    cart.add(product);
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void removeProduct(Map<String, dynamic> product) {
    cart.remove(product);
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

The Provider implementation:
- Centralizes shopping cart state
- Provides simple methods for adding and removing products
- Triggers UI updates with notifyListeners() when the state changes
- Allows widgets to watch or read cart state as needed

Example of consuming the provider:
```dart
// Reading cart data
final cart = context.watch<CartProvider>().cart;

// Updating cart
context.read<CartProvider>().addProduct(product);
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a feature-based organization:

```
shop_app/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart              # Application entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ global_variables.dart  # Static product data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/                 # Main screens
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home_page.dart     # Main container with navigation
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cart_page.dart     # Shopping cart screen
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ product_details_page.dart  # Product details view
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ providers/             # State management
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cart_provider.dart # Shopping cart state
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ widgets/               # Reusable UI components
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ product_card.dart  # Product display card
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ product_list.dart  # Grid/list of products
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/                    # Static resources
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/                # Product images
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fonts/                 # Custom typography
â””â”€â”€ pubspec.yaml               # Project configuration
```

- Delete functionality with confirmation dialog
- Clean, minimalist design for easy reading
- Consistent styling with main app theme

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Consumes cart state from CartProvider

## Data Flow

1. **Product Data Source**: Static product data in global_variables.dart
2. **Product Selection Flow**:
   - User browses products in ProductList
   - User selects a product to view details
   - ProductDetailsPage receives the selected product data
   - User selects a size and adds to cart
   - CartProvider updates the cart state
3. **Cart Management Flow**:
   - CartPage displays products from CartProvider
   - User can remove items from the cart
   - CartProvider updates the state and notifies listeners
   - UI reflects the updated cart state

## Responsive Design

Shop-App implements a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes:

```dart
// Example of responsive design implementation
Expanded(
  child: size.width > 650 
    ? GridView.builder(/* Grid layout for larger screens */) 
    : ListView.builder(/* List layout for smaller screens */),
)
```

Responsive features include:
- Flexible layouts that adapt to screen dimensions
- GridView for larger screens, ListView for smaller screens
- Appropriately sized text and UI elements
- Consistent spacing and padding across device sizes
